# autohome
My first attempt at creating my own Home Automation suite. The plan is to run microservices and each separate integration (solar, security, cams) will run as a separate service and provides the mobile app with it's own interface implementation so that the core doesn't need to know about the specific integrations user interface.

This code is all relatively old and I'm looking at a different concept for a similar thing so this repo may be updated at some point with the new concept or I'll start a new repo.
